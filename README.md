# SH-IT!!

To save various bash script (or command) hacks

## Usage

If you want to run a script without copying-pasting shit
(especially installation scripts), just type:

```bash
bash <(curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/haeramkeem/sh-it/main/path/to/script)
```

Or you can just look around the scripts I pushed in [here](https://gist.github.com/haeramkeem)
